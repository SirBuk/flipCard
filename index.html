	<h1>Class participation: General</h1>
    <h3>Make your expectations clear</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Reassure students that speaking up during class is appropriate and expected in Australia.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Provide clear guidelines on how to participate. Put these up on a poster or PowerPoint slide or on a handout.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    <b>Show</b> them what you mean by ‘being engaged’, don’t just <b>tell</b> them. The Class Participation vide may help.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Use role models: if one student makes a good contribution, praise them and remind the class that this is what you want.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Limit the audience</h3>
  	<ul>
    	<li>
        Put student in pairs or small groups: this often makes them more comfortable about making contributions.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Nominate a speaker to ‘report back’ to the class, and change the speaker each time. This way they have preparation time.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Provide clear guidelines (e.g. structured questions) to the groups or pairs that each student must follow in turn.
    	</li>
	</ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Provide warning and preparation time</h3>
    <p>Spontaneous public speaking in English and be daunting!</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>
        Be specific about which student you want to speak, rather than asking a question and hoping for a volunteer.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Give the student advanced warning about what and when they will be contribution (tell them early on or ask them in a particular order, e.g. “go around the room”).
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Allow students time to prepare before they speak in public (a few minutes’ group discussion time can serve this purpose).
    	</li>
        <br>
        <li>
        Ask very reticent student to read something aloud, warn them, and give them a few minutes to prepare.
    	</li>
        <br>

  <h1>Class participation: Eliciting contributions</h1>
    <h3>Motiving students about group work</h3>
    <p>For <b>closed questions</b> (e.g. “What is the annual profit?”)</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Go around the class and ask each student in turn for an answer, so they know when they’re up next.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    At the start of class, allocate questions or task to specific students, so they have time to prepare (e.g. “For each test question, David’s job is to give us the units.”).
    </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>For <b>open questions</b> (e.g. “What do you think?”)</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Let the students discuss the question in pairs/groups and:
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Go from group to group asking or thoughts while the discussion is on (providing a sense of privacy), and/or
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    When you announce the discussion, tell each group to nominate a speaker to report back (allow preparation).
    </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Getting students to ask question in class</h3>
  	<ul>
    	<li>
        Use <b>role models:</b> if a student does ask a question, praise them and encourage other students to follow their example. </li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
     Allow time at the end of class for students to ask questions one- on-one which is less intimidating.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        When students ask questions after class, praise them for asking and encourage them to ask questions in class as well.
    	</li>
	</ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Facilitating class</h3>
    <p>Ask students to record:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>
        Open-ended discussion prompts may be challenging at first. Get them started with <b>structured questions or guidelines</b> in pairs or small groups before they speak to the class.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Good topics to inspire discussion: food, sport, gifts, movies, technology, shopping, controversial events involving people in or from their country, generational differences.
    	</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div id="facilitating" class="tabcontent">
	<h1>Facilitating group work</h1>
    <h3>Motiving students about group work</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Tie group work to their careers: in the global workplace they will need to work in 	multicultural teams!
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Provide explicit, step-by-step instructions on what they must do (e.g., hold meeting, delegate, take minutes)
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Get student to hold their first group meeting in class time, so you can supervise and assist.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Putting student into group</h3>
  	<ul>
    	<li>
        Most student gravitate towards peers from their own culture if given the choice.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Encourage cross-cultural communications by randomly assigning students to pairs/groups for the start.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        If you want students to choose their groups, build in incentives for cross-cultural communication.
    	</li>
        <br>
    	<li>
        Provide specific guidelines for discussion not open-ended prompts.
    	</li>
	</ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Monitoring individual contributions</h3>
    <h4>Ask students to record:</h4>
    <ul>
    	<li>
        When they hold group meeting and who attended them.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        What each person contributed during each meeting.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        How tasks are delegated to group members.
    	</li>
        <br>
        <li>
        What each person has done between meetings.
    	</li>

    <h3>Layout and formatting</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Font size for main text no smaller than 28 points.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    No more the two lines per bullet point.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Line should be spaced at a minimum of 24 points.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Aim for no more than 10 bullet points per slide.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Set your bullet points to come up one by one on a mouse click.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Content</h3>
  	<ul>
    	<li>
        Think of bullet points as headlines for you explanation and examples, <b>not</b> a speech cut into pieces!
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        No sentences or phrases more than two clauses long.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        <b>Show as well as tell.</b> Use visuals (pictures, graphs maps diagrams) with or instead of text wherever possible.
    	</li>
	</ul>
    <br>
</div>

<div id="speakingEnglish" class="tabcontent">
	<h1>Speaking accessible English</h1>
    <h3>General tips</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Enunciate clearly and don’t talk to fast.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Pause a little after each clause, stress key words to allow students time to process, watch students carefully to make sure they are following you.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Don’t just <b>tell</b> students <b>show</b> them: use visuals, put important information in writing or on a slide/handout.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Show enthusiasm for you subject.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Set your bullet points to come up one by one on a mouse click.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
  	<ul>
    	<li>
        Use straight forward, everyday English words.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Use simple grammar: avoid subordinate clauses, long convoluted sentences passive voice.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Be careful with jargon and technical word. Provide a printed glossary, or give students relevant terms in advance so they can look them up.
    	</li>
        <br>
    	<li>
        Be careful with slang and idiom. Keep them to a minimum, and explain them if you use them.
    	</li>
	</ul>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Making teaching accessible</h3>
  	<ul>
    	<li>
        For lectures give students a list of the main points to be covered, and refer to it as you speak.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Ask simple open questions to check understanding (doing this one-on-one or during a group activity Is less intimidating for students).
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Directing questions at the class hoping someone will volunteer and answer (throwing to the floor”) often doesn’t’ work. See ‘Class Participation’.
    	</li>
        <br>
    	<li>
        For further information see ‘Speaking accessible English’ in your Teachers Handbook.
    	</li>
	</ul>
    <br>
</div>

<div id="writingAssessment" class="tabcontent">
	<h1>Writing accessible English: Assessment tasks</h1>
    <h3>Structured tasks</h3>
    <p>In <b>structured tasks</b> the teacher provides a framework which makes it very clear what students are meant to do. Here are some examples of structured tasks:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Link the term with its definition.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    True/false.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Multiple choice.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Reproduce a passage from memory.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Cloze tests (fill in the gap).
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Complete the sentence exercises.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Complete the graph or diagram exercise.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Summarise a key passage in half the words.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Unstructured tasks</h3>
    <p>In <b>unstructured tasks</b> (essays, reports, short answer questions, oral presentations etc.) the teacher provides minimal guidelines and students create their own answers. Some students may never has done unstructured tasks before. It helps to:</p>
  	<ul>
    	<li>
        Provide explicit, step-by-step instructions on <b>(a)</b>what they must do, <b>(b)</b>how to do it, <b>(c)</b>over what time frame and <b>(d)</b>
what help and support they can access.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Put key words which tell students what is expected in <b>bold</b> and make sure students understand what they mean.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Don’t just explain the task orally, provide something in writing and take students through it in class.
    	</li>
        <br>
    	<li>
        Provide an annotated example of the type of assessment task you’re setting (for oral presentations, use video footage).
    	</li>
        <br>
    	<li>
        Describe what sort of answer you expect (e.g. “Write a <b>short paragraph</b> about…”).
    	</li>
	</ul>
    <br>
</div>

<div id="writingGeneral" class="tabcontent">
	<h1>Writing accessible English: General</h1>
    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Write straightforward, everyday English.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Use simple, everyday word and phrases.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Use common words (e.g. “cause”) rather than obscure or formal words (e.g. “precipitate”, “instigate”, “trigger”).
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Include only essential jargon, technical terms and acronyms. Put these in bold when they first appear, include a definition in the text or refer students to a glossary or endnote/footnote.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Layout and formatting</h3>
  	<ul>
    	<li>
        Keep your sentences short: no more than three clauses long.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Paragraphs should be no more than three cluses long.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Break long paragraphs into shorts paragraphs and bulleted lists (where applicable).
    	</li>
        <br>
    	<li>
        Put the key word or phrase which tells the student what to do in <b>bold</b>.
    	</li>
        <br>
	</ul>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Grammar</h3>
  	<ul>
    	<li>
        Avoid subordinate clauses (“Their costs, <b>which were vast</b>, are…”).
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Use the <b>active voice</b> (“Students misread the text”) not the <b>passive voice</b> (“The test was misread”).
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Phrase thins literally (e.g. “Woolco were <b>surprised</b> by their 2003 profits”). Don’t use idiomatic phrases (e.g. Woolco were <b>blown away</b> by their 2003 profits.”).

	<h1>Teaching international students: Common challenges</h1>
    <h3>Class participation</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>
    No response to questions asked of the whole class.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Difficulty in getting students to speak up (ask/answer questions, make comments, etc.) during class.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Asking teachers questions only after class.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Seeking help from peers instead of the teacher.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Difficulty with unstructured assessment tasks</h3>
  	<ul>
    	<li>
        Reproducing memorised passages for textbooks, lectures in assessments tasks.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Inexperience with typical Australian academic requirements such as critical thinking, analysis, group work, classroom discussion, writing essays, etc.
    	</li>
	</ul>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Difficulty with group work</h3>
  	<ul>
    	<li>
        Formatting groups only with same-culture peers.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Difficulty collaborating on tasks.
    	</li>
	</ul>
    <br>
    
        <h3>Why these challenges are common</h3>
        <p>Most challenges stem from international students not being used to the Australian education style. Many students will:</p>
  		<ul>
    	<li>
        Be used to one-way class, where the teacher speaks, students listen and interruption is rude.
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        Only have been asses through structured tasks.
    	</li>
        <br>
    	<li>
        Be used to education where memorising and reproducing information is central to achievement.
    	</li>
        <br>
    	<li>
        Have limited or no experience with apply theories, critical analysis, group work and unstructured tasks.

<div id="givingFeedback" class="tabcontent">
	<h1>Giving feedback</h1>
    <h3>General</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Feedback should provide input which student can apply in their next piece of work
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    <b>Show as well as tell students what makes good work.</b> E.g. take students through an example of a good short answer in class, explaining what makes it good.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Encourage ore-submission, where students give you a preliminary draft for guidance before they submit.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Don’t just provide global feedback (general comments about the assignment); <b>be specific</b> in your praise and criticism.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Be very clear about what you expectations were in the task and where these were met and not met.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Marking</h3>
  	<ul>
    	<li>
        Explain to students how their work will be assessed. If you have a marking scheme, provide it to student (provided the language is clear and straightforward).
    	</li>
    	<br>
    	<li>
        If appropriate show students an example of similar task and take them through how you would mark it.
    	</li>
        <br>
    	<li>
        Break the mark into component for English expression, understanding information covered, etc.
    	</li>
        <br>
    	<li>
        For essays, be conscious of how the students’ first language shapes how they write.d, etc.
